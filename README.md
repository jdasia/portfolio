### Elevator pitch 

Hey, Iâ€™m Jeff! I attended London Southbank during Covid-19 with a Level 4 in Psychology. During the
pandemic, I signed a recording contract with an independent label in London and spent the next 
two years playing guitar while releasing material and observing related data online, especially on
Spotify. This sparked my interest into the demographic of my audience and propensity of my work.
Working part time as the receptionist at a youth centre in Essex while finishing my contractual
obligations, I helped with registrations, sign-ins , payments, two community events and being the
first point for information or items. I also updated fields in a bespoke Salesforce CRM that kept
record of members, staff and visitors. After embarking on a gov funded Bootcamp programme with
JustIT I feel empowered by my data skills to uncover insights and evidence-based truth. I used C#
for my final project when I did computer science at Level 3. I now feel confident using SQL to
manage databases and records and Python for data cleaning and modelling. I am excited to help
drive momentum in our data based world by taking on an apprenticeship.
